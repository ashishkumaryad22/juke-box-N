# Jukebox-
Java Programming Project

I have designed a console-based modern jukebox that allows users to listen to music and podcasts
that are live streamed. There are a lot of tracks and episodes on the jukebox. So,
whether youâ€™re behind the wheel, working out, partying or relaxing, the right music or
podcast is always at your fingertips. You can also browse through the artists, and
celebrities, or create a playlist and just sit back.

  - The jukebox contains a catalog of songs and podcasts.
  - The home page of the jukebox displays all the songs available in the catalog
  - The Catalog can be categorized based on the artist, genre or name of the album, by celebrity or date on which the podcast was
    published
  - A user create a playlist of songs or podcasts or a combination of the two
  - User can add a song or a particular album or a podcast to the created playlist
  - User can create multiple playlists and can view the contents of the playlists
